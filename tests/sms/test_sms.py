# POST (Twilio-protected)
# - This is the twilio messagin webhook endpoint.  It only responds to
# twilio-verified requests.  It responds in twiml (https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/twiml)
#
# When a user interacts with this endpoint (sends a text to this service), even
# if the user has not been seen before, they are enrolled and automatically
# verified.  We give their account an invalid password hash so that they are
# forced to setup (i.e., reset) a password if they later choose to log into the
# service a different way.  Importantly, their account is marked as
# is_phone_verified=True because they must have a usable phone number if they
# are able to send a message to the Twilio messaging endpoint.
#
# For ease of use, this endopint sends async http requests to the other
# endpoints in the service.  While inefficient, it allows us to reuse the code
# at those endpoints as well as spread out the load a little in the kubernetes
# cluster.
#
# A user only has one Chat via their phone number.  It uses a reserved chat name
# that is setup when they create an account.
# TODO Missing Tests
# - Test that the openai message break character works "|"
# - Test that the welcome message includes a contact card for the AI (or link to one)
